# Hip-Hop/Rap Culture Quiz
This is an interactive quiz page that utilizes jQuery to manipulate the DOM, which was learned during Week 5 of the UW Coding Boot Camp. This quiz is a brief glimpse into the polarizing culture of the Hip-Hop/Rap genre, which I grew up listening to, and this assignment really challenged my knowledge of JavaScript.

# Usage
The landing page gives a brief description of the rules and quiz contents. The user can view 'High Scores' which are stored in localStorage. Once the 'Start Button' is clicked, a timer begins counting down from seventy-five seconds (fifteen seconds per question) and the first question is displayed. The user can choose their answer by clicking, which then prompts the next question. However, if the answer is incorrect, ten seconds will be deducted from the timer. The user's score will be determined by the remaining amount of time at the end of the quiz, or they will be given a '0' if time runs out.
